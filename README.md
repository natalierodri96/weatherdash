The purpose of this task to to be able tp retreive data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. 
## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Using the WeatherApp API we should be able to search for a city and it displays current and future conditions for that city and that city.

I tried to keep the design elements basic so I can focus on the script. I was having some issues and I wasn't able to pinpoint if the issue was with the API key or something within the code itself. I tried playing around with it in different ways but wasn't able to get the api working properly.
